## About

Scheduler UFRGS is a scheduling system for courses and classes at UFRGS (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul). The application allows users to schedule courses and create timetables for their classes using HTML and JavaScript.


## Features

- **Course Management**: Add and manage courses, with the ability to remove them if necessary.

- **Class Management**: Add and manage classes for each course, specifying the days and times they occur.

- **Schedule Creation**: Create timetables by selecting classes and intuitively adjusting the schedule.

- **Image Saving**: Save timetables as JPEG images directly to your device.

- **Data Persistence**: Your courses and schedules are automatically saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they are preserved even after closing the browser.


## Usage

Upon opening Scheduler UFRGS in your web browser, you will see the main interface, which consists of the following sections:

1. **Cadeiras**: This section allows you to add courses. To add a course, enter the course name and click "Adicionar". The added courses will be displayed in a list below.

2. **Turmas**: This section allows you to add classes (turmas) for each course. To add a class, select the course, time slot, days, and enter the class name (turma). Click "Adicionar" to add the class. The added classes will be displayed in a table below.

3. **Grade Options**: This section displays the class selection options for creating the timetable. Select the desired class for each course from the dropdown menus. The selected classes will be automatically highlighted in the timetable.

4. **Grade de Horários**: This section displays the timetable with all the added classes. The timetable is divided into time slots (Horários) and days (Segunda, Terça, Quarta, Quinta, Sexta). Selected classes will be highlighted with their respective colors as defined in the Grade Options. To show only the currently selected classes, check the "Mostrar apenas selecionados" checkbox above the table. The "Salvar como JPEG" button under the table allows you to save the current state of the timetable as a JPEG image to your device.

To remove a course or class, simply click the delete button (X icon) next to it in the corresponding section.
